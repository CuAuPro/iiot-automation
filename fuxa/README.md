## 📁 FUXA

This is the **FUXA** directory.

It contains volume-mapped folders used by the [Frangoteam FUXA](https://github.com/frangoteam/FUXA) container, including:

-   `appdata/` – application-specific data
    
-   `db/` – internal project/database storage
    
-   `logs/` – log files
    
-   `images/` – uploaded images and assets
    

No special setup is required here. The container will read/write directly to these folders when running.
